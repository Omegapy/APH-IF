# --- Module Objective ---
# This module provides functionality for downloading Title 30 CFR (Code of Federal
# Regulations) PDF documents from the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) website.
# It implements a robust download mechanism with retry logic, rate limiting, and error
# handling to collect mining regulatory documents for the MRCA knowledge base. The module
# serves as the initial data collection component in the MRCA Advanced Parallel Hybrid
# system pipeline, gathering the regulatory source documents that will be processed
# into the hybrid knowledge store for regulatory compliance assistance.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Module Contents Overview ---
# - Class: CFRDownloader - Main class for downloading CFR regulatory documents
# - Function: main() - Entry point for the CFR document download process
# - Global Constants: Console output configuration for download monitoring
# - Dependencies: Standard library modules and requests for HTTP operations
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Dependencies / Imports ---
# - Standard Library:
#   - os: File system operations and directory management
#   - time: Rate limiting and retry delays for download operations
#   - requests: HTTP client for downloading PDF documents from GPO website
# - Third-Party:
#   - requests: Download CFR documents from the GPO website
# - Local Project Modules: None (standalone document acquisition utility)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Usage / Integration ---
# This module is designed as a standalone script for initial data acquisition in the
# MRCA system setup workflow. It downloads Title 30 CFR PDF documents from the official
# U.S. Government Publishing Office website and stores them in the data/cfr_pdf directory
# for subsequent processing by the hybrid knowledge store builders. The module should be
# executed before running the graph construction or hybrid store building processes to
# ensure the latest regulatory documents are available for knowledge base population.
