### PHASE 1 — Implementation Summary and Handoff

This document summarizes what was implemented in Phase 1 and sets clear expectations for Phase 2.

### What was delivered in Phase 1
- **Three services up and running (Dockerized):**
  - **backend (FastAPI)**: `GET /healthz`, stub `POST /query`
    - Port: `8000`
  - **data_processing (FastAPI)**: `GET /healthz`
    - Port: `8010`
  - **frontend (Streamlit)**: status pill shows backend health; submits to `/query`
    - Port: `8501`

- **Per-service environment files (.env)**
  - `backend/.env` (empty in Phase 1)
  - `data_processing/.env` (empty in Phase 1)
  - `frontend/.env` with `BACKEND_URL` (Compose default: `http://aph_if_backend:8000`)
  - Sample `.env.example` files should be maintained per service in Phase 2+

- **Tooling and project scaffolding**
  - Root files: `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `test/e2e_test_query.py`
  - `common/` package with placeholders: `__init__.py`, `config.py`, `logging.py`, `models.py` (to be implemented in later phases)

### How to run (dev)
- Start services
  - With Make: `make dev-up`
  - Without Make: `docker compose up -d --build`

- Verify health
  - Backend: `http://localhost:8000/healthz` → `{ "status": "ok", "service": "backend" }`
  - Data processing: `http://localhost:8010/healthz` → `{ "status": "ok", "service": "data_processing" }`
  - Frontend UI: `http://localhost:8501` (sidebar pill indicates backend status)

- Test the stub query
  - `POST http://localhost:8000/query` with `{ "query": "What is APH-IF?" }`
  - Expected: `{"answer": "Stub answer to: ...", "citations": [], ...}`

### Testing and quality gates
- Run tests: `pytest -q`
- Lint: `ruff check .`
- Type check: `mypy .`

### Files and key locations
- Services
  - `backend/app/main.py` — FastAPI app with `/healthz` and stub `/query`
  - `data_processing/app/main.py` — FastAPI app with `/healthz`
  - `frontend/app/bot.py` — Streamlit UI (status pill + basic query box)
- Root
  - `docker-compose.yml` — 3 services, ports 8000/8010/8501
  - `test/e2e_test_query.py` — host-based smoke test for backend
  - `pyproject.toml` — ruff, mypy, pytest config
  - `Makefile` — convenience targets (`dev-up`, `dev-down`, `logs`, `test`, `lint`, `type`)
- Shared placeholders (Phase 1 only)
  - `common/config.py`, `common/logging.py`, `common/models.py`

### Notes and constraints
- Phase 1 intentionally avoids external services (no Neo4j, no embeddings, no API keys).
- Per-service `.env` files are used via `env_file` in Compose (no secrets committed).
- Compose deprecation warning: removing `version:` from `docker-compose.yml` is recommended.

### Handoff to Phase 2 (what to implement next)
- **Guardrails & templates (doc artifacts)**
  - Author agent prompt guides in `docs-for-AI/` for:
    - Traversal agent (LLM→Cypher) with JSON-only output contract
    - Vector agent (grounded summaries, no fabrication)
    - Fusion agent (merge hits with citations; abstain on insufficient evidence)

- **Contracts & validation (code)**
  - Implement Pydantic models in `common/models.py`:
    - `QueryRequest`, `RetrievedChunk`, `GraphHit`, `FusionInput`, `FusionOutput`, `Citation`
  - Add validation + retries around strict JSON outputs (Phase 2 tests should validate contracts)

- **Logging and tracing (code)**
  - Implement `common/logging.py` with structlog JSON logs and request IDs
  - Wire basic timing metrics in endpoints (healthz, query)

- **Testing scope (Phase 2)**
  - Unit: model validation, JSON parsing/repair of agent outputs
  - Integration: round-trip prompt → model validation (mock LLM)

- **Acceptance for Phase 2**
  - Prompt rules exist in `docs-for-AI/` with few-shot examples
  - Pydantic models implemented and validated via tests
  - Backend can enforce/repair agent JSON outputs to match schemas

This document should be used by Phase 2 as the single source of truth for the current system state and for the concrete next steps to implement guardrails, templates, and schemas.
