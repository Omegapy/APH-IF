# Project: APH-IF
#
# Project description:
# Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Intelligent Fusion (APH-IF)
# is a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that differs from
# traditional RAG approaches by performing semantic and traversal searches
# concurrently, rather than sequentially, and fusing the results using an LLM
# or an LRM to generate the final response.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# --- Module Functionality ---
#   Defines Pydantic request and response models shared by FastAPI routers.
#   These models provide the validated data contracts for query and health
#   endpoints exposed by the APH-IF backend service.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Module Contents Overview ---
# - Class (BaseModel): QueryRequest
# - Class (BaseModel): QueryResponse
# - Class (BaseModel): HealthResponse
# - Constant: __all__ (module exports)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Dependencies / Imports ---
# - Standard Library: typing (Any)
# - Third-Party: pydantic (BaseModel)
# - Local Project Modules: None
# --- Requirements ---
# - Python 3.12
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Usage / Integration ---
# Imported by routers under `backend/app/api/routers` to validate request and
# response payloads for query and health endpoints exposed through FastAPI.

"""Typed API contracts for the APH-IF backend service.

Collects Pydantic models that describe the payloads exchanged by query and
health endpoints. Imported by FastAPI routers within `backend/app/api` to keep
serialization schemas consistent across the service.
